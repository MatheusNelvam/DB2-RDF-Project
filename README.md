**General Project Description: Supply Chain Ontology**

This project involves the creation of an ontology to model concepts and relationships within a supply chain. An ontology is a formal, semantic representation of a specific domain, and, in this case, we are using the OWL (Web Ontology Language) to structure and define entities relevant to supply chain management.

### Project Objective

The primary goal of this ontology is to provide a clear and semantic framework to represent different elements involved in a supply chain, such as supply chain projects, shipments, vendors, products, countries, and more. By employing an ontology, we aim to enhance understanding and interoperability among systems dealing with supply chain-related information.

### How to Use

To utilize the ontology, you can explore and edit concepts and relationships in Protegé, an ontology editing tool. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the project's README to clone the repository, open the ontology in Protegé, add instances, define relationships, and save your changes.

### Key Components

The main classes in the ontology include:

- **SupplyChainProject:** Represents specific projects related to the supply chain.
- **Shipment:** Represents the physical shipment of products.
- **Vendor:** Represents suppliers or sellers.
- **Product:** Represents specific products.
- **Country:** Represents countries.

Additionally, properties such as `belongsToChain`, `hasShipment`, `suppliesProduct`, `projectName`, `vendorName`, `shipmentDate`, and `productPrice` are used to define specific relationships and attributes.

### Disclaimer

This project is a conceptual representation and is not intended to be a ready-to-use implementation. The adaptability of the ontology to specific cases may require modifications according to user needs.


We hope this ontology serves as a valuable tool for modeling and understanding processes in supply chains, promoting interoperability, and facilitating communication among systems dealing with information related to this specific domain.
