# DB2-RDF-Project

## 2023/11/11 - Project Update

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Basic Ontology Creation:**
   - Created the foundational structure of the ontology based on the provided Excel data.

### Next Steps:

#### 2. Modify and Complete the Ontology:

   a. **Country Class:**
      - Investigate how to properly define the 'Country' class. Explore possibilities of importing existing RDF data for subclasses like 'CountryName' and 'CountryCode.'

   b. **Disjoint With Attribute:**
      - Research and implement the 'disjoint with' attribute in the ontology to ensure proper modeling.

   c. **Adding Instances:**
      - Explore methods to add instances of classes and subclasses. Consider practical approaches for populating the ontology with relevant data.

#### 3. Study Slides and Complete Tasks:

   - Review lecture slides to gain insights into modeling the domain of interest.
   - Create a visual graph representation of the model.
   - Generate an OWL file for the ontology by the end of next week.

### General Notes:

- Regularly update this markdown file to document progress and any challenges encountered.
- Consider using tools or libraries that facilitate RDF and OWL ontology development.
- Collaborate with the team to gather insights and address any concerns.
- Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks to streamline the workflow.
